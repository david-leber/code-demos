title: "Loops - Repeating Actions"
description: "Learn how to repeat code using for and while loops"
objectives:
  - "Understand how loops work"
  - "Use for loops to iterate over sequences"
  - "Use while loops for conditional repetition"
starter_code: |
  # Loops let you repeat code multiple times
  # For loop example:

  for i in range(5):
      print("Count:", i)

  # While loop example:
  count = 0
  while count < 3:
      print("While count:", count)
      count += 1

hints:
  - "Use 'for' with range() to loop a specific number of times"
  - "Use 'while' to loop as long as a condition is true"
  - "Don't forget to update the condition in while loops!"

    test_code: |
      import sys
      from io import StringIO

      # This is a simple test
      # In practice, you'd capture output and verify
      print("✓ If you see numbers 1-10 above, you did it!")
    solution_example: |
      for i in range(1, 11):
          print(i)
