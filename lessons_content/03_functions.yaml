title: "Functions - Reusable Code"
description: "Learn how to create and use functions to organize your code"
objectives:
  - "Understand what functions are and why they're useful"
  - "Learn how to define functions with def"
  - "Use parameters and return values"
starter_code: |
  # Functions let you reuse code
  # Define a function using 'def'

  def greet(name):
      return "Hello, " + name + "!"

  # Call the function
  message = greet("World")
  print(message)

hints:
  - "Use 'def' to define a function"
  - "Function names should be descriptive"
  - "Use 'return' to send a value back from the function"
  - "Don't forget the colon : after the function definition"

    test_code: |
      # Test the function
      if 'add_numbers' in dir():
          try:
              result = add_numbers(5, 3)
              if result == 8:
                  print("✓ Great! Your function works correctly!")
              else:
                  print(f"✗ Expected 8, but got {result}")
          except Exception as e:
              print(f"✗ Error calling function: {e}")
      else:
          print("✗ Please create a function called add_numbers")
    solution_example: |
      def add_numbers(a, b):
          return a + b

      # Test it
      print(add_numbers(5, 3))  # Should print 8
