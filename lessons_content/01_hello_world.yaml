title: "Hello, World!"
description: "Your first Python program - learn how to print output to the console"
objectives:
  - "Understand how to use the print() function"
  - "Write your first Python program"
  - "Learn about strings in Python"

concepts:
  - "The print() function displays text to the screen"
  - "Strings are text enclosed in quotes (single or double)"
  - "Python executes code line by line from top to bottom"
  - "Comments start with # and are ignored by Python"

examples:
  - |
    # This prints a simple message
    print("Hello, World!")
  - |
    # You can use single or double quotes
    print('Hello!')
    print("Hello!")
  - |
    # Print multiple lines
    print("Line 1")
    print("Line 2")

starter_code: |
  # Welcome to your first Python lesson!
  # Use the print() function to display "Hello, World!"

hints:
  - "Use the print() function"
  - "Put your text in quotes: print('your text here')"
  - "Try running the code with the Run button"

      # This is a simple check - in practice you'd want more robust testing
      output = buffer.getvalue()
      sys.stdout = old_stdout

      if "Hello, World!" in output or "hello, world!" in output.lower():
          print("✓ Test passed! Great job!")
      else:
          print("✗ Test failed. Make sure your output contains 'Hello, World!'")
