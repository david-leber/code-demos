title: "Variables and Data Types"
description: "Learn how to store and use data with variables"
objectives:
  - "Understand what variables are"
  - "Learn how to assign values to variables"
  - "Work with different data types (strings, numbers)"

concepts:
  - "Variables are containers that store values"
  - "Use the = operator to assign values to variables"
  - "Variable names should be descriptive"
  - "Python has different data types: strings (text), integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers)"
  - "You can change a variable's value at any time"

examples:
  - |
    # Creating a variable
    name = "Alice"
    print(name)
  - |
    # Numbers don't need quotes
    age = 25
    score = 98.5
    print(age)
    print(score)
  - |
    # Using variables together
    first_name = "Bob"
    last_name = "Smith"
    print(first_name, last_name)

starter_code: |
  # Variables let you store values and reuse them
  # Try creating variables for your name and age

  name = "Your Name"
  age = 0

  print("My name is", name)
  print("I am", age, "years old")

hints:
  - "Use = to assign values to variables"
  - "Variables can store text (strings) or numbers"
  - "You can use variables in print() statements"

    test_code: |
      # Check if the variable exists and has the right value
      if 'favorite_language' in dir():
          if favorite_language == "Python":
              print("✓ Correct! Python is awesome!")
          else:
              print("✗ Make sure favorite_language is set to 'Python'")
      else:
          print("✗ Please create a variable called favorite_language")
    solution_example: |
      favorite_language = "Python"
      print("My favorite language is", favorite_language)
